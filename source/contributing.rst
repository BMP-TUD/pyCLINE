Contributing to pyCLINE
=======================

If you want to contribute to the ``pyCLINE`` package, you can do it in the `Gitlab <https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/gelenslab/publications/pycline>`_ repository by creating a feature either for bug reports or suggestions. 

If you have already written code to fix bugs or add extensions then feel free to creat a pull request, however before putting substantial effort into major code changes please open an issue to discuss it.
